# Axedit Rewrite

A complete rewrite of the axedit text editor. Aiming to:

- Use a better CLI interface
- Use technologies like treesitter for better builtin syntax highlighting
- Use an actual running neovim instance for vim motions
- Use fzf or skim for fuzzy finding files in directory
- Make command bar with better future insight
