# Thanks for trying Axedit

- This editor started as a random project and turned into something more. I use this as my main editor myself,
  not just because I made it, but because I strived to inherit the key features of my previous editors and extend them.
  To me, I'm only able to use this editor because I genuinely find it convenient, since it implements something as powerful
  as Vim and also has some Python/Pygame specific things. Of course, it also works just as fine for non-pygame projects, but
  for pygame projects its certainly a tad bit more helpful.
- I do not ask you to switch to this editor, but I do thank you for trying this. If you are like me, you may find this
  sufficient for your use, and it would certainly make me happy if you tried switching to it, but do so only if it has
  the things you require.

## What this tutorial covers

- This tutorial teaches you how to use Vim, and it was made by `vintharas`.
- You don't have to go through the entire tutorial, but just a few pages and you should be ready to use
  vim on a daily.
