# Baby Steps in Vim

Oh no!? If you try to type stuff with the curious looking
rectangle shaped cursor nothing happens!?
Or strange things happen ?!!?

Ok. Take a deep breath. I haven't broken your editor. Yet.

Vim is quite a strange editor. It has modes.
A mode for navigating/editing, a mode for inserting text,
a mode for selecting text. This is good. It gives Vim the
ability to really take advantage of that keyboard of yours
because it can concentrate in just one single task at a time.

The mode that is active right now (with the rectangular shaped cursor)
is **normal mode**. In that mode, Vim focus solely on navigating super
fast around the code and editing,
two of the most common things you do when you code.

Let's start practicing the basics of
movement in normal mode: `hjkl`. `hjkl`
allow you to move the cursor one space in every direction.

If it sounds weird, think that you're in a game.

Yeah! Congrats! You're now rich and can settle in a beautiful ascii palace!

                                   |
                               _  _|_  _
                              |;|_|;|_|;|
                              \\.    .  /
                               \\:  .  /
                                ||:   |
                                ||:.  |
                                ||:  .|
                                ||:   |       \,/
                                ||: , |            /`\
                                ||:   |
                                ||: . |
 __                            _||_   |
    '--~~__            __ ----~    ~`---,
           ~---__ ,--~'                  ~~----_____-~'
```

Now that we've learned the most basic of movements let's take
a look at how you can make your editor behave like you are used to:
**Insert mode**. **Insert mode** is where Vim focuses in inserting
bits of text and code, just like a normal editor.

- Type `i` to get into **Insert mode**.
- Type `<ESC>`, `<CTRL-[>` or `<CTRL-C>` to get back to **Normal mode**.
  Complete these sentences. Practice using `i` to get into
  **Insert mode** and `<ESC>` (or any of the others)
  to get into **Normal mode**.

I want to learn Vim because its cool!
My favorite food is Pizza!
I'd die for a some good icecream!
If I went to a desserted island I'd bring a cool machine gun!

Awesome! Great job!
